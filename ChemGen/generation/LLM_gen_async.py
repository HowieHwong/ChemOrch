INSTRUCTION_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Your goal is to produce a diverse set of instructions (or questions) based on a given user task. The corresponding answers will be generated later to form a dataset.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Task Understanding:** Carefully analyze the provided task and determine its core objective.
2. **Instruction Generation:** Create exactly `{n}` unique instructions related to the task. The instructions should be diverse in phrasing and complexity.
3. **Clarity & Context:** Ensure each instruction is clear and provides enough context for an AI model to generate a meaningful response.
4. **Format:** Return the instructions strictly as a Python-style list of strings.
5. **Generation Mode:** There are two possible modes for generating instructions: metadata, free.
Metadata: Your instructions should strictly adhere to the metadata provided below.
Free: Your instructions should only focus on the task, task description and possible constraints.
**Mode**: {mode}
6. **Custom Constraint:** {custom_constraint}


### **Example:**
#### **User Task:** Toxicity Prediction  
#### **Generated Instructions (Example Output):**  

[
    "Does benzo[a]pyrene exhibit toxicity to humans?",
    "What is the acute toxicity of trichloroethylene?",
    "Does bisphenol A have endocrine-disrupting effects?",
    "Do pyridine compounds have neurotoxic effects?",
    "Does tetraethyl lead pose long-term toxicity risks to the environment and humans?"
]

INSTRUCTION_PLANNING_PROMPT = """
You are an advanced AI assistant tasked with planning how to solve a given instruction. Your goal is to **break down the problem into structured steps** that can be executed using external tools or reasoning. You should **not** provide an answerâ€”only a plan.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Understand the Instruction:** Carefully analyze the given instruction to determine its requirements.
2. **Identify Key Elements:** Identify key components such as subject, method, and expected output.
3. **Break Down into Steps:** Generate a structured plan consisting of logical steps that guide the problem-solving process.
4. **Ensure Tool Compatibility:** If an external tool is likely required (e.g., a chemical database, scientific literature, mathematical solver), indicate it explicitly.
5. **Format:** Return the planning steps strictly as a Python-style list of strings.

Now, generate a structured plan for the following instruction:

Instruction: {instruction}

Ensure the output is formatted strictly as a Python list of strings. 
"""

IDEAL_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = """
Your goal is to describe the functionalities of these tools concisely, ensuring that each tool serves **one specific purpose**.

### **Instructions:**
1. **Analyze the Planning Steps:** Carefully review the provided planning steps to determine what kind of external tools would be needed to complete them.
2. **Define the Ideal Toolset:** Describe **only the necessary** tools, ensuring that each tool performs only **one function**.
3. **Keep Descriptions Concise:** Each tool description should be brief and focused on its function.
4. **Limit the Number of Tools:** Minimize the number of tools by **combining related functionalities** into single tools where applicable.
5. **Format:** Return the tool descriptions strictly as a Python-style list of strings.

Now, generate a structured list of ideal tool descriptions for the following planning steps:

Planning Steps: {planning_steps}

Ensure the output is formatted strictly as a Python list of strings, with each tool description containing only one function.
